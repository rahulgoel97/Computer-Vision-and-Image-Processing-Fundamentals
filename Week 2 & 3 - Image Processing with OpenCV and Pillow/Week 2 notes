Week 2 notes

Spatial Operations in Image Processing
- Pooling - averaging a bunch of filters into one pixel
- Z = W * X , where W is kernel with pretermined values
- Edge detection - shap changes in brightness (pixel intensity values)
-> dI/dx = change in pixel i+1 and pixel i
-> Sobel operator kernels can be used for edge detection

- Median filters - median value of area
